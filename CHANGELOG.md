## [0.2.0] — Unreleased

### Added — Google Gemini provider
- `src/ai/providers/gemini.ts`: new `GeminiProvider` class using the Gemini REST API (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta`)
  - Translates `assistant` role to `model` (Gemini's convention)
  - System prompt sent via `system_instruction` field
  - Default model: `gemini-1.5-flash`
- `src/ai/types.ts`: added `'gemini'` to the `provider` union type
- `src/ai/index.ts`: registered `GeminiProvider` in the factory
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx`: added "Google (Gemini)" option to the provider dropdown with `AIza…` key placeholder

### Added — About NekoAI menu
- `src/PanelWindow.tsx`: 
  - Added "ℹ About NekoAI" button to context menu (before Quit)
  - About sub-view displays project info, creator (Naudy Castellanos), contact email, and GitHub star button
  - Panel resizes to 300px when showing About view; Escape/Back returns to menu
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`: added `open_url` command using `tauri_plugin_shell::ShellExt` to open URLs/mailto links

### Fixed — Size selector
- `src/PanelWindow.tsx`: size buttons now call `setPetSize()` locally before relaying via `panelAction`, so the active-size highlight updates immediately (mode buttons already followed this pattern; size buttons did not)
- `src/App.tsx`: added `useEffect([spriteSize, isLoaded])` that calls `resize_window` whenever pet size changes — previously the store updated but the OS window never resized, clipping larger sprites; also fixes initial load when saved size differs from the 32×32 default window

### Fixed — UI & Animations
- `src/components/PetSelector.tsx`: 
  - Add window expand/collapse effect when opening/closing pet selector (fixes invisible panel)
  - Remove dark overlay background (rgba(0,0,0,0.5)) that showed as outer rectangle; replace with nearly-invisible rgba(0,0,0,0.01)
  - Set explicit panel width for consistent layout across window sizes
- `src/components/SpeechBubble.tsx`:
  - Replace typewriter animation with scramble text effect
  - Characters progressively lock in left-to-right with 5-char lookahead of random noise
  - Maintains ~30ms per character reveal speed for smooth decode feel
  - Spaces and newlines pass through without scrambling for readability

### Added — Persistent memory
- `storage.rs`: `get_all_user_facts()` Tauri command returns all stored facts as a map
- `src/ai/memory.ts`: new module — `loadFacts()` and `extractAndSaveFacts()`
  - Extracts name, current project, and programming language from conversation text
  - Runs asynchronously after each AI reply (fire-and-forget)
- `src/ai/index.ts`: `buildContextBlock()` now accepts `facts` and optional `mood`
  - Facts injected as `key=value` pairs into the AI system prompt
  - Mood described in natural language ("sleepy, content, curious")
- `src/App.tsx`: `handleSendMessage` replaces `mockAI` placeholder
  - Saves every message to SQLite, loads 20-message history and all facts per turn

### Added — Dynamic mood engine
- `src/hooks/useMoodEngine.ts`: new hook, polls every 60 s using refs to avoid stale closures
  - `energy` — sinusoidal day/night curve + OS idle penalty (−4 per idle minute, max −50)
  - `happiness` — higher during waking hours (7am–10pm)
  - `curiosity` — based on active app category (coding → 75, other → 40)
  - Emits `yawn` animation override when OS idle is between 3–5 minutes
- `src/App.tsx`: applies `moodOverride ?? currentAnimation` to `PetRenderer`

### Added — Multiple pets
- `pets/manifest.json`: registry file read by `PetSelector` to list available pets
- `pets/ghost-pixel/pet.json`: Ghost — ethereal, gentle personality, full animation set defined
- `pets/shiba-pixel/pet.json`: Shiba — loyal, enthusiastic personality, full animation set defined
- `src/components/PetSelector.tsx`: fetches `manifest.json` dynamically on open; shows "sprites needed" badge for pets awaiting sprites
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`: tray menu includes Ghost and Shiba entries; version bumped to v0.2.0
- `src/App.tsx`: pet loading now re-fetches on `activePetId` change (was hardcoded to `classic-neko`)

### Added — Documentation
- `docs/creating-a-pet.md`: full guide — folder structure, `pet.json` spec, sprite requirements, manifest and tray registration steps
- `docs/architecture.md`: frontend layers, Rust commands table, SQLite schema, chat-turn data flow diagram

### Fixed
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx`: updated `buildContextBlock()` call to new signature
